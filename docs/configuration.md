# Configuration

Lossless-claw reads plugin configuration from `plugins.entries.lossless-claw.config`.

Configuration precedence is:

1. Environment variables
2. `plugins.entries.lossless-claw.config`
3. Built-in defaults from [`src/db/config.ts`](../src/db/config.ts)

Most installations only need to override a handful of keys. If you want a complete starting point, use the full example below and then delete entries you do not need.

## Complete `plugins.entries.lossless-claw.config` example

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "databasePath": "/Users/alice/.openclaw/lcm.db",
  "largeFilesDir": "/Users/alice/.openclaw/lcm-files",
  "ignoreSessionPatterns": [],
  "statelessSessionPatterns": [],
  "skipStatelessSessions": true,
  "contextThreshold": 0.75,
  "freshTailCount": 64,
  "freshTailMaxTokens": 24000,
  "newSessionRetainDepth": 2,
  "leafMinFanout": 8,
  "condensedMinFanout": 4,
  "condensedMinFanoutHard": 2,
  "incrementalMaxDepth": 1,
  "leafChunkTokens": 20000,
  "bootstrapMaxTokens": 6000,
  "leafTargetTokens": 2400,
  "condensedTargetTokens": 2000,
  "maxExpandTokens": 4000,
  "largeFileThresholdTokens": 25000,
  "summaryProvider": "",
  "summaryModel": "",
  "largeFileSummaryProvider": "",
  "largeFileSummaryModel": "",
  "expansionProvider": "",
  "expansionModel": "",
  "delegationTimeoutMs": 120000,
  "summaryTimeoutMs": 60000,
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
  "pruneHeartbeatOk": false,
  "transcriptGcEnabled": false,
  "maxAssemblyTokenBudget": 30000,
  "summaryMaxOverageFactor": 3,
  "customInstructions": "",
  "circuitBreakerThreshold": 5,
  "circuitBreakerCooldownMs": 1800000,
  "fallbackProviders": [],
  "proactiveThresholdCompactionMode": "deferred",
  "cacheAwareCompaction": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxColdCacheCatchupPasses": 2,
    "hotCachePressureFactor": 4,
    "hotCacheBudgetHeadroomRatio": 0.2
  },
  "dynamicLeafChunkTokens": {
    "enabled": true,
    "max": 40000
  }
}
```

Notes on the example:

- Values shown are the runtime defaults when a fixed default exists.
- `databasePath` shows the expanded default path shape. Use an absolute path in config rather than `~`.
- `largeFilesDir` shows the expanded default path shape. Both `databasePath` and `largeFilesDir` default to paths under `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` (which in turn falls back to `~/.openclaw`).
- `timezone` has no fixed hardcoded default; at runtime it resolves from `TZ` first, then the system timezone. The example uses `America/Los_Angeles`.
- `maxAssemblyTokenBudget` has no default. The example uses `30000` as a realistic cap for a 32k-class model.
- `databasePath` is the preferred key. `dbPath` is an accepted alias.
- `largeFileThresholdTokens` is the preferred key. `largeFileTokenThreshold` is an accepted alias.

## Reference

### Core storage and session behavior

| Key | Type | Default | Env override | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | `LCM_ENABLED` | Enables or disables lossless-claw without uninstalling it. |
| `databasePath` | `string` | `${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR}/lcm.db` | `LCM_DATABASE_PATH` | Preferred path for the SQLite database. |
| `dbPath` | `string` | alias of `databasePath` | `LCM_DATABASE_PATH` | Legacy alias for `databasePath`. Prefer `databasePath` in new config. |
| `largeFilesDir` | `string` | `${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR}/lcm-files` | `LCM_LARGE_FILES_DIR` | Directory where externalized large files and inline images are persisted. Automatically follows the active state directory. |
| `ignoreSessionPatterns` | `string[]` | `[]` | `LCM_IGNORE_SESSION_PATTERNS` | Session-key glob patterns that skip LCM entirely. |
| `statelessSessionPatterns` | `string[]` | `[]` | `LCM_STATELESS_SESSION_PATTERNS` | Session-key glob patterns that may read from LCM but never write to it. |
| `skipStatelessSessions` | `boolean` | `true` | `LCM_SKIP_STATELESS_SESSIONS` | Enforces `statelessSessionPatterns` when enabled. |
| `newSessionRetainDepth` | `integer` | `2` | `LCM_NEW_SESSION_RETAIN_DEPTH` | Controls what survives `/new`. `-1` keeps all context, `0` keeps summaries only, higher values keep only deeper summaries. |
| `timezone` | `string` | `TZ` or system timezone | `TZ` | IANA timezone used for timestamp rendering in summaries. |
| `pruneHeartbeatOk` | `boolean` | `false` | `LCM_PRUNE_HEARTBEAT_OK` | Retroactively removes `HEARTBEAT_OK` turn cycles from persisted storage. |
| `transcriptGcEnabled` | `boolean` | `false` | `LCM_TRANSCRIPT_GC_ENABLED` | Enables transcript rewrite GC during `maintain()`; disabled by default so transcript rewrites stay opt-in. |
| `proactiveThresholdCompactionMode` | `"deferred" \| "inline"` | `"deferred"` | `LCM_PROACTIVE_THRESHOLD_COMPACTION_MODE` | Controls whether proactive threshold compaction is deferred into maintenance debt by default or run inline for legacy behavior. |

> **Multi-profile note:** `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` (set by the host OpenClaw gateway) controls where state is stored. When two gateways run on the same host (e.g. separate bot personas), each gateway sets its own `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` and lossless-claw automatically uses that directory for the database, large-file payloads, auth-profile lookups, and legacy secrets — no per-profile plugin config is needed.

| Key | Type | Default | Env override | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Fallbacks, circuit breaking, and safety rails

| Key | Type | Default | Env override | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fallbackProviders` | `Array<{ provider: string; model: string }>` | `[]` | `LCM_FALLBACK_PROVIDERS` | Explicit provider/model fallback chain for compaction summarization. Format for env vars is `provider/model,provider/model`. |
| `circuitBreakerThreshold` | `integer` | `5` | `LCM_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` | Consecutive auth failures before the summarization circuit breaker trips. |
| `circuitBreakerCooldownMs` | `integer` | `1800000` | `LCM_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_COOLDOWN_MS` | Cooldown before the summarization circuit breaker resets automatically. |

### Nested objects

#### `cacheAwareCompaction`

| Key | Type | Default | Env override | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cacheAwareCompaction.enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | `LCM_CACHE_AWARE_COMPACTION_ENABLED` | Defers incremental leaf compaction more aggressively when prompt-cache telemetry indicates a hot cache. |
| `cacheAwareCompaction.cacheTTLSeconds` | `integer` | `300` | `LCM_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Fallback cache TTL used when deferred Anthropic compaction has provider/model telemetry but no explicit runtime cache-retention window. |
| `cacheAwareCompaction.maxColdCacheCatchupPasses` | `integer` | `2` | `LCM_MAX_COLD_CACHE_CATCHUP_PASSES` | Maximum bounded catch-up passes allowed in one maintenance cycle when cache telemetry is cold. |
| `cacheAwareCompaction.hotCachePressureFactor` | `number` | `4` | `LCM_HOT_CACHE_PRESSURE_FACTOR` | Multiplier applied to the hot-cache leaf trigger before raw-history pressure overrides cache preservation. |
| `cacheAwareCompaction.hotCacheBudgetHeadroomRatio` | `number` | `0.2` | `LCM_HOT_CACHE_BUDGET_HEADROOM_RATIO` | Minimum fraction of the real token budget that must remain free before hot-cache incremental compaction is skipped entirely. |
| `cacheAwareCompaction.coldCacheObservationThreshold` | `integer` | `3` | `LCM_COLD_CACHE_OBSERVATION_THRESHOLD` | Consecutive cold observations required before non-explicit cache misses are treated as truly cold. This dampens one-off routing noise and provider failover blips. |

#### `dynamicLeafChunkTokens`

| Key | Type | Default | Env override | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dynamicLeafChunkTokens.enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | `LCM_DYNAMIC_LEAF_CHUNK_TOKENS_ENABLED` | Enables dynamic working leaf chunk sizes for busier sessions. |
| `dynamicLeafChunkTokens.max` | `integer` | `max(leafChunkTokens, floor(leafChunkTokens * 2))` | `LCM_DYNAMIC_LEAF_CHUNK_TOKENS_MAX` | Upper bound for the dynamic working chunk size. With the default `leafChunkTokens=20000`, this resolves to `40000`. |

### Cache-aware incremental compaction

When cache-aware compaction is enabled:

- hot cache stretches the incremental leaf trigger to `dynamicLeafChunkTokens.max`
- hot cache skips incremental maintenance entirely when the assembled context is still comfortably below the real token budget
- hot cache also gets a short hysteresis window so one ambiguous turn does not immediately discard a recently healthy cache signal
- cold cache still allows bounded catch-up passes via `cacheAwareCompaction.maxColdCacheCatchupPasses`

When incremental leaf compaction still runs on a hot cache, follow-on condensed passes are suppressed so the maintenance cycle only pays for the leaf pass that was explicitly justified.

## Behavior notes

### Summary model resolution

Compaction summarization resolves candidates in this order:

1. `LCM_SUMMARY_MODEL` and `LCM_SUMMARY_PROVIDER`
2. `plugins.entries.lossless-claw.config.summaryModel` and `summaryProvider`
3. OpenClaw's default compaction model
4. Legacy per-call provider and model hints
5. `fallbackProviders`

If `summaryModel` already contains a provider prefix such as `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `summaryProvider` is ignored for that candidate.

Runtime-managed OAuth providers are supported here too. In particular, `openai-codex` and `github-copilot` auth profiles can be used for summary and expansion calls without a separate API key.

A practical starting point for cost-sensitive setups is:

```env
LCM_SUMMARY_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.4-mini
LCM_EXPANSION_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.4-mini
```

### Session pattern matching

`ignoreSessionPatterns` and `statelessSessionPatterns` use full session keys.

- `*` matches any characters except `:`
- `**` matches anything, including `:`

Example:

```json
{
  "ignoreSessionPatterns": [
    "agent:*:cron:**"
  ],
  "statelessSessionPatterns": [
    "agent:*:subagent:**",
    "agent:ops:subagent:**"
  ],
  "skipStatelessSessions": true
}
```

### `/new` and `/reset`

Lossless-claw treats OpenClaw reset commands differently:

- `/new` keeps the active LCM conversation and prunes active context according to `newSessionRetainDepth`
- `/reset` archives the active conversation row and creates a fresh active row for the same stable `sessionKey`

This keeps long-term history available while still giving users a real clean-slate reset.

### Deferred proactive compaction

Lossless-claw now defaults `proactiveThresholdCompactionMode` to `deferred`.

- deferred mode records a single coalesced maintenance debt row per conversation
- deferred mode persists provider/model/cache telemetry so Anthropic-family sessions can avoid rewriting a still-hot prompt cache
- `maintain()` can still process non-prompt-mutating work when the host explicitly opts in to deferred execution, but it leaves prompt-mutating debt pending while Anthropic cache is still hot
- `assemble()` consumes deferred prompt-mutating debt pre-assembly once the cache is cold or the next turn is already approaching overflow
- `/lcm status` / `/lossless status` shows the current maintenance state, including pending/running/last-failure details
- status output also surfaces the latest API/cache telemetry so operators can see whether a deferred debt item is being preserved for cache-safety reasons
- set `proactiveThresholdCompactionMode` to `inline` only if you need the legacy inline proactive compaction behavior for compatibility

### `/lcm rotate`

`/lcm rotate` exists for a different use case than `/new` or `/reset`:

- `/new` keeps the same active LCM conversation row and only prunes context.
- `/reset` changes OpenClaw session flow, which is sometimes more disruptive than users want.
- `/lcm rotate` keeps the live OpenClaw session identity, but archives the current active LCM row and starts a fresh row for the same session.

Before rotating, Lossless-claw replaces one rolling `rotate-latest` SQLite backup. The new row is checkpointed at the current transcript frontier so bootstrap starts from now forward instead of replaying older transcript history into the fresh row. If you want additional timestamped snapshots, run `/lcm backup` explicitly before `/lcm rotate`.

## Environment-only knobs outside plugin config

These settings are not part of `plugins.entries.lossless-claw.config`, but they still affect the system:

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` | `~/.openclaw` | Active state directory for the OpenClaw gateway. When set, all path defaults (database, large files, auth profiles, secrets) resolve relative to this directory instead of `~/.openclaw`. Set automatically by OpenClaw for non-default profiles. |
| `LCM_TUI_CONVERSATION_WINDOW_SIZE` | `200` | Number of messages `lcm-tui` loads per keyset-paged conversation window. |

## Database operations

The SQLite database lives at `databasePath` or `LCM_DATABASE_PATH`. The default path is `${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR}/lcm.db` (resolves to `~/.openclaw/lcm.db` when `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` is not set).

Inspect it with:

```bash
sqlite3 "${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.openclaw}/lcm.db"

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conversations;
SELECT * FROM context_items WHERE conversation_id = 1 ORDER BY ordinal;
SELECT depth, COUNT(*) FROM summaries GROUP BY depth;
SELECT summary_id, depth, token_count FROM summaries ORDER BY token_count DESC LIMIT 10;
```

Back it up with:

```bash
cp "${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.openclaw}/lcm.db" "${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.openclaw}/lcm.db.backup"
sqlite3 "${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.openclaw}/lcm.db" ".backup ${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.openclaw}/lcm.db.backup"
```

Or from a supported OpenClaw chat/native command surface:

```text
/lcm backup
```

## Disabling lossless-claw

To disable the plugin but keep it installed:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "lossless-claw": {
        "enabled": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To switch back to OpenClaw's legacy context engine instead:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": {
      "contextEngine": "legacy"
    }
  }
}
```
