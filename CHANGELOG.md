## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- [#444](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/444) [`6596fb4`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/6596fb4f3113aa34799662b46698d5fdd053683f) Thanks [@andyylin](https://github.com/andyylin)! - Fix context-engine registration so the plugin only registers its canonical `lossless-claw` id, align runtime Pi package versions with the current OpenClaw stack, and tighten selection helpers to stop treating the old `default` alias as equivalent to the plugin id.

- [#455](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/455) [`370b91b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/370b91b58033a890f5ff9e97fd2a950a50618ba4) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Wrap SQLite migrations in a single exclusive transaction so concurrent startup agents serialize migration work instead of racing on per-statement autocommit writes.

- [#465](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/465) [`6f7f942`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/6f7f942ca516bf43dbec9b098a84defcd1677328) Thanks [@liu51115](https://github.com/liu51115)! - Harden defensive handling for non-string database path and timestamp values so malformed runtime data does not trigger `.trim()` crashes or silently skew stored chronology.

- [#405](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/405) [`5949a4b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5949a4b8a4e35281421b3f3a18c0c95897d3cf4f) Thanks [@uf-hy](https://github.com/uf-hy)! - Restrict the missed-`/reset` bootstrap fallback to confirmed missing transcript paths so transient `stat()` failures do not rotate a live conversation.

- [#450](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/450) [`36c80d5`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/36c80d5f8b12483ff4de827359fd22da61b8192b) Thanks [@coryscook](https://github.com/coryscook)! - Use the resolved plugin summary config when runtime config is unavailable so compaction keeps the configured summary model instead of falling back to emergency truncation.

- [#418](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/418) [`f8fe367`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f8fe367c9c7d18c0d2b470c72f799e516150c8aa) Thanks [@gitchrisqueen](https://github.com/gitchrisqueen)! - Fix manual and threshold-triggered compaction results so a full sweep that ends under the target budget reports `already under target` instead of a misleading no-op failure.

- [#468](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/468) [`082b2a9`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/082b2a918c2721001ea30e952bde95bc500b7241) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Unify `lcm-tui` summary provider configuration across doctor, repair, rewrite, and backfill so the standalone commands honor the same provider, model, and base URL overrides as interactive rewrite.

- [#467](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/467) [`6580e8f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/6580e8f641e3b19d7b452d030a71a2d871106722) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Fix `lcm-tui` OAuth-backed Claude rewrites, repairs, and doctor apply runs so large prompts stream over stdin instead of overflowing the CLI argument limit.

- [#456](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/456) [`134bb8a`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/134bb8aadada3e8e6884940843ad4ebaeb0bf254) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Improve prompt-cache stability by making compacted-context guidance static and disabling prompt-aware eviction by default.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- [#392](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/392) [`00d1fa2`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/00d1fa2c5a7cd2c1b77adb0a9f6c103e487f5e52) Thanks [@GodsBoy](https://github.com/GodsBoy)! - Avoid repeated full bootstrap rereads when an unchanged session transcript misses the normal checkpoint fast paths.

- [#305](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/305) [`2d1446f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/2d1446f29b2e54701baf5b234c2937a5b2909bd7) Thanks [@stilrmy](https://github.com/stilrmy)! - Fix startup-time summary model resolution when OpenClaw populates plugin config before the top-level runtime config surface.

- [#388](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/388) [`5bdd596`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5bdd596f6c3223c3cdaf12c15ba44b685d1b61c6) Thanks [@bennybuoy](https://github.com/bennybuoy)! - Fix the built-in API-family fallback for `ollama` providers so summarization can use OpenAI-compatible Ollama models without requiring an explicit `models.providers.ollama.api` setting.

- [#433](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/433) [`5c8ef34`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5c8ef34ff6baf551a42c73dc1b217a3bb4828891) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Apply content-recency sorting consistently to CJK summary full-text search so recent summarized content does not lose to older but stronger trigram matches.

- [#441](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/441) [`26708b9`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/26708b9b0b788babba4d1349158414722b18af63) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Keep deferred incremental compaction debt pending until oversized raw backlog is actually compacted, and let budget-triggered catch-up scale passes with prompt overage instead of forcing one pass per turn.

- [#434](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/434) [`049ce3b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/049ce3b82339ad373dcc6ef6346fb98087c65159) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Keep deferred Anthropic leaf compaction moving once the prompt-cache TTL has gone stale, even if cache-aware cold-observation smoothing still treats the session as effectively hot for routing-noise protection.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#408](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/408) [`abf31da`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/abf31da5a5978fc40096699dbb1f52f97d766aaa) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Added deferred proactive compaction as the default mode, with explicit maintenance debt tracking and status visibility so foreground turns no longer run threshold compaction inline unless compatibility mode is enabled.

- [#355](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/355) [`6e9388c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/6e9388c17036caa6021ab075e4d91ee928d73986) Thanks [@LanicBlue](https://github.com/LanicBlue)! - Externalize inline base64 images before large tool-result text compaction, and add `largeFilesDir` / `LCM_LARGE_FILES_DIR` so externalized payload storage can be configured explicitly.

### Patch Changes

- [#403](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/403) [`ea7d532`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ea7d5327d648790350724c15990b5c1ab98bf611) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Convert bootstrap's file I/O off the Node.js event loop. `readFileSegment` and `readLastJsonlEntryBeforeOffset` previously used sync `openSync`/`readSync`/`statSync`, which could block the gateway for minutes while scanning multi-MB JSONL transcripts during the bootstrap append-only path. The bootstrap entry `statSync` and `refreshBootstrapState` helper are now async as well. The backward-scan loop now only reads new chunks when the current carry has no more newlines, and the fast path short-circuits before the backward scan when the DB's latest hash no longer matches the checkpoint (the common case during active sessions, where the scan can never succeed).

- [#395](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/395) [`2c05599`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/2c05599c7ac6977be47b3358589c8a43332b2d23) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Add `/lcm backup` and `/lcm rotate` plugin commands so users can snapshot the SQLite database on demand and split oversized active LCM conversations without changing their live OpenClaw session identity. Rotation now checkpoints the current transcript frontier so the fresh row starts from now forward instead of replaying older transcript history.

- [#425](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/425) [`3faa9bd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/3faa9bdb04c5fc01833a2b64a478f224254793a0) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Report the canonical `lossless-claw` context-engine id from the runtime engine metadata so newer OpenClaw builds accept the plugin's registered engine slot.

- [#420](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/420) [`e0fa375`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/e0fa375ae6fcd5964dae56cadf368e1718649128) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Fix `/lcm rotate` so it waits for the live database connection to become idle, takes a faithful pre-rotate backup on that connection, and then compacts the current session transcript without replacing the active LCM conversation. Rotation now preserves the existing conversation id, summaries, and context items while refreshing bootstrap state so dropped transcript history is not replayed.

- [#415](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/415) [`7668717`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/7668717ba3790c208baa8bcb9c4f2ae4f35d7910) Thanks [@ryanngit](https://github.com/ryanngit)! - Handle conversation creation races on active session keys without crashing the caller.

- [#413](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/413) [`347add7`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/347add70429ab64b81e2191afa354857e03fd16f) Thanks [@ryanngit](https://github.com/ryanngit)! - Increase the SQLite busy timeout to 30 seconds to better tolerate concurrent writer contention without spurious `SQLITE_BUSY` failures.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- [#400](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/400) [`1711957`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/17119577e847750f3c08ab84e47e0e6628bca9ed) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Strip comments from the pre-bundled dist/index.js so the OpenClaw install-time code safety scanner no longer flags JSDoc prose (e.g. "Fetch all context items") as a network-send pattern and blocks installation with an `env-harvesting` false positive.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- [#379](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/379) [`7f42703`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/7f4270327ac22cc9028ff4261d44b53561d93a50) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Improve the `session_id` fallback conversation lookup by adding the matching composite index so SQLite can satisfy the latest-conversation query without a scan and temp sort.

- [#366](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/366) [`f4177ec`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f4177ec9f06af3dbc9da5241288f62e61bcd26c0) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Fix bootstrap recovery when a session rotates to a new transcript file so stale summaries and checkpoints are cleared before re-importing the replacement session history.

- [#376](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/376) [`06a05e5`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/06a05e515828cc99c4bbd1ceb4edfaa40f869264) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Add startup diagnostics that attribute resolved ignore/stateless pattern sources, and warn when env-backed pattern arrays override plugin config arrays.

- [#353](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/353) [`6fa2829`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/6fa2829929c14f0c3175efd59a4df68c0e5b8d45) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Pre-bundle the plugin to `dist/index.js` using esbuild before publishing. This eliminates the per-invocation TypeScript compilation overhead caused by OpenClaw's JITI loader recursively transpiling every `.ts` source file, reducing CLI startup latency from 15–25 s to near-instant.

- [#354](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/354) [`b0ad788`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/b0ad78872e3f51fe6b1b1bed0a9c93e8e439554e) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Honor `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` for the default database, large-file storage, auth-profile, and legacy secret paths so multi-profile OpenClaw gateways do not read and write each other's state.

- [#380](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/380) [`33ecb88`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/33ecb8828b6f6258b6884da15e5750af07a0f846) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Stop rerunning startup summary and tool-call backfills after they complete successfully, while still retrying the same backfill version cleanly if startup fails before the completion marker is written.

- [#371](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/371) [`597ec70`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/597ec700f09660aa58899ef6ef3f37d19112e0df) Thanks [@holgergruenhagen](https://github.com/holgergruenhagen)! - Avoid treating omitted LCM summarizer reasoning settings like reasoning-disabled requests for reasoning-capable models by applying a low default only when the resolved model supports reasoning.

- [#377](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/377) [`3b2d34c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/3b2d34c4e68601e37ce3b012bb38ae4ca5e977af) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Add an opt-in `transcriptGcEnabled` config flag, defaulting it to `false`, and skip transcript-GC rewrites during `maintain()` unless the flag is enabled. Also add startup diagnostics and documentation for the new setting.

- [#387](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/387) [`5113044`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5113044bbbea5af36324e2a546c5adc40b8aabb2) Thanks [@oguzbilgic](https://github.com/oguzbilgic)! - Refresh the bootstrap checkpoint after normal `afterTurn()` ingestion so persistent sessions can keep using the append-only bootstrap fast path after real conversation turns.

- [#323](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/323) [`e781980`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/e781980ee706f5d67c902b903a003eaf7665c8e4) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Allow `lcm_expand_query(allConversations: true)` to synthesize bounded answers across multiple conversations, including per-conversation diagnostics for partial or truncated results.

### Patch Changes

- [#344](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/344) [`897a953`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/897a953300b35208b894050ac73bc8160a03b0da) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Keep compaction summary caps and deterministic fallback truncation within budget for CJK-heavy and emoji-heavy content.

- [#331](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/331) [`d7a57c5`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d7a57c51361307fa27818d14c2c7b426609c9ee8) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Recover from malformed legacy `summaries_fts` tables during migration instead of crashing plugin startup.

- [#334](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/334) [`71d6d9c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/71d6d9ce1a0846f85cefd92e6895c7cfaee2350a) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Harden malformed FTS migration recovery so stale trigram tables are cleaned up before other FTS schema probes and startup migrations no longer skip recovery by reusing a cached FTS5 capability check.

- [#172](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/172) [`8bf5e7f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/8bf5e7fb73b02d75350aae7cc47df46f9b425f1a) Thanks [@craigamcw](https://github.com/craigamcw)! - Skip ingesting empty assistant messages from errored or aborted provider responses so they do not accumulate in assembled context and trigger retry loops.

- [#318](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/318) [`b7078df`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/b7078df9c4466c6249a8c0f11424a6e75ea7be4c) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Make incremental leaf compaction cache-aware by deferring extra passes while prompt caching is hot, allowing bounded catch-up when the cache goes cold, and adding `cacheAwareCompaction` config controls for the behavior.

- [#319](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/319) [`3bc5bde`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/3bc5bde7a52b163ee2fe7f22302e97e3e8295b11) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Document the full lossless-claw configuration surface and align the plugin manifest schema and UI hints with the runtime-supported config keys.

- [#294](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/294) [`43342d9`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/43342d9fea5c62ea4320a7bca60732bad09122d2) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Tune SQLite defaults for large lossless-claw databases by increasing the page cache, keeping temporary structures in memory, and using WAL-friendly synchronous settings.

  Add missing indexes for `summary_messages(message_id)` and `summaries(conversation_id, depth, kind)` so summary cleanup and depth-filtered queries avoid full table scans on existing databases.

- [#257](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/257) [`ea43f58`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ea43f58746cf8c96b8feb5a9f6b8a1fe02477573) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Fix the hardened `afterTurn()` replay dedup path so it ingests the intended post-turn batch, and add coverage for restart replay when an auto-compaction summary is present.

- [#180](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/180) [`ea84f45`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ea84f454a07d205ff225b5c73d4f91f73e2614bd) Thanks [@GodsBoy](https://github.com/GodsBoy)! - Fix prompt-aware context eviction so blank or otherwise unsearchable prompts fall back to the existing chronological behavior instead of entering the relevance-scoring path.

- [#178](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/178) [`0613b7f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/0613b7fc7707a4ccea1ffbf7d2c8be82bd4dcee6) Thanks [@catgodtwno4](https://github.com/catgodtwno4)! - Fix summarizer auth-error detection so real provider auth envelopes nested under `data` or `body` still trigger handling, while successful summary payloads in `message` or `response` no longer cause false-positive auth failures.

- [#242](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/242) [`3fe823f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/3fe823f4dcec720c158f712fa4c4487482e80ade) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Move static lossless recall policy guidance into the plugin prompt hook while keeping `systemPromptAddition` limited to session-specific compaction reminders.

  This makes the stable recall-order guidance cacheable, clarifies that lossless-claw takes precedence over generic memory recall only for compacted conversation history, and leaves deep-compaction expand-before-asserting guidance in the dynamic assembled prompt.

- [#252](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/252) [`e843638`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/e8436388311e110b983d280e2157a9f013e41d4e) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Sync the published plugin manifest schema with the runtime-supported plugin config surface so documented config keys are accepted by OpenClaw. This also removes the undocumented `autocompactDisabled` setting from the advertised config surface because it was parsed but not wired to runtime behavior.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- [#185](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/185) [`ec74779`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ec747792c01153e44f08bfbf410ddf2526fca7cf) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Fix `lcm-tui doctor` to detect third truncation marker format (`[LCM fallback summary; truncated for context management]`) and harden Claude CLI summarization with `--system-prompt` flag and neutral working directory to prevent workspace contamination.

- [#186](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/186) [`c796f7d`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/c796f7d9d014a19f2b55e62895a32327b0347694) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Harden LCM summarization so provider auth failures no longer persist fallback summaries, and stop forcing explicit temperature overrides on summarizer requests.

- [#182](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/182) [`954a2fd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/954a2fd848b6444561e26afc2b41ad01e27d5a08) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Improve `lcm-tui` session browsing by showing stable session keys in the session list and conversation header, and align the session list columns so message counts and LCM metadata are easier to scan.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- [#159](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/159) [`20b6c1b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/20b6c1bd0c8c5903ce4498e9cef235392fa0cfc4) Thanks [@tmchow](https://github.com/tmchow)! - Fix legacy tool-call backfill for rows that stored ids under `metadata.raw.call_id`.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#157](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/157) [`f3f0aa2`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f3f0aa29e636542e47f5020a1d6759dff023d798) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Add `lcm-tui doctor` command for auto-detecting and repairing truncation-fallback summaries. Features position-aware marker detection (rejects false positives from summaries that quote markers in narrative text), bottom-up repair ordering, OAuth/token CLI delegation, and transaction-safe dry-run mode.

- [#138](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/138) [`9047e49`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9047e49a91db0e4cba83f4f1c11fc10a899e5528) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Add incremental bootstrap checkpoints and large tool-output externalization.

  This release speeds up restart/bootstrap by checkpointing session transcript state,
  skipping unchanged transcript replays, and using append-only tail imports when a
  session file only grew. It also externalizes oversized tool outputs into
  `large_files` with compact placeholders so long-running OpenClaw sessions keep
  their full recall surface without carrying giant inline tool payloads in the
  active transcript.

### Patch Changes

- [#156](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/156) [`968b1d6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/968b1d6b2ff41a297645309aa7c1d7dc80bee7ab) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Fix compaction auth failures: surface provider auth errors instead of silently aborting, fall back to deterministic truncation when summarizer returns empty content, fall through to legacy auth-profiles.json when modelAuth returns scope-limited credentials. TUI now sets WAL mode and busy_timeout to prevent SQLITE_BUSY during concurrent usage.

- [#129](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/129) [`133665c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/133665c24d5e4bdd1ad01cd4373b65af5d37d868) Thanks [@semiok](https://github.com/semiok)! - Use LIKE search for full-text queries containing CJK characters. SQLite FTS5's `unicode61` tokenizer can return empty or incomplete results for Chinese/Japanese/Korean text, so CJK queries now bypass FTS and use the existing LIKE-based fallback for correct matches.

- [#132](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/132) [`4522a72`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4522a7217511dc99be2576ac49cb216515213aea) Thanks [@hhe48203-ctrl](https://github.com/hhe48203-ctrl)! - Persist the resolved compaction summarization model on summary records instead of
  always showing `unknown`.

  Existing `summaries` rows keep the `unknown` fallback through an additive
  migration, while newly created summaries now record the actual model configured
  for compaction.

- [#126](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/126) [`437c240`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/437c240c580e0407f4732b401792bec10ab50f1b) Thanks [@cryptomaltese](https://github.com/cryptomaltese)! - Annotate attachment-only messages during compaction without dropping short captions.

  This release improves media-aware compaction summaries by replacing raw
  `MEDIA:/...` placeholders for attachment-only messages while still preserving
  real caption text, including short captions such as `Look at this!`, when a
  message also includes a media attachment.

- [#146](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/146) [`c37777f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/c37777f416afb088f816fe1bb10b17773d08306f) Thanks [@qualiobra](https://github.com/qualiobra)! - Fix a session-queue cleanup race that could leak per-session queue entries during
  overlapping ingest or compaction operations.

- [#131](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/131) [`bab46cc`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/bab46ccd633ee159443b965793cb83cb64f673a2) Thanks [@semiok](https://github.com/semiok)! - Add 60-second timeout protection to summarizer LLM calls. Previously, a slow or unresponsive model provider could block the `deps.complete()` call indefinitely, starving the Node.js event loop and causing downstream failures such as Telegram polling disconnects. Both the initial and retry summarization calls are now wrapped with a timeout that rejects cleanly and falls through to the existing deterministic fallback.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 45f714c: Add `expansionModel` and `expansionProvider` overrides for delegated
  `lcm_expand_query` subagent runs.
- 1e6812a: Add session scoping controls for ignored and stateless OpenClaw sessions,
  including cron and subagent pattern support, and make runtime summary model
  environment overrides win reliably over plugin config during compaction.

### Patch Changes

- 518a1b2: Restore automatic post-turn compaction when OpenClaw omits the top-level
  `tokenBudget`, by resolving fallback budget inputs consistently before using
  the default compaction budget.
- 6c54c7b: Declare explicit OpenClaw tool names for the LCM factory-registered tools so
  plugin metadata and tool listings stay populated in hosts that require
  `registerTool(..., { name })` hints for factory registrations.
- 9ee103a: Fix condensed summary expansion so replay walks the source summaries that were compacted into a node, and skip proactive compaction when turn ingest fails to avoid compacting a stale frontier.
- ae260f7: Fix the TUI Anthropic OAuth fallback so Claude CLI summaries respect the selected model and stay within the expected summary size budget.
- 8f77fe7: Run LCM migrations during engine startup and only advertise `ownsCompaction`
  when the database schema is operational, while preserving runtime compaction
  settings and accurate token accounting for structured tool results.
- 7fae41c: Fix assembler round-tripping for tool results so structured `tool_result` content is preserved and normalized tool metadata no longer inflates context token budgeting.
- ceee14e: Restore stable conversation continuity across OpenClaw session UUID recycling
  by resolving sessions through `sessionKey` for both writes and read-only
  lookups, and keep compaction/ingest serialization aligned with that stable
  identity.
- bbd2ecb: Emit LCM startup and configuration banner logs only once per process so
  repeated OpenClaw plugin registration during snapshot loads does not duplicate
  the same startup lines.
- 82becaf: Remove hardcoded non-LCM recall tool names from the dynamic summary prompt so
  agents rely on whatever memory tooling is actually available in the host
  session.
- 6b85751: Restore compatibility for existing OpenClaw sessions that still reference the
  legacy `default` context engine, and improve container deployments by adding a
  supported Docker image and startup flow for LCM-backed OpenClaw environments.
- 828d106: Improve LCM summarization model resolution so configured `summaryModel`
  overrides, OpenClaw `agents.defaults.compaction.model`, and newer
  `runtimeContext` inputs are honored more reliably while preserving
  compatibility with older `legacyCompactionParams` integrations.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f1dfa5c: Catch up the release notes for work merged after `0.2.8`.

  This release adds Anthropic OAuth setup-token support in the TUI, resolves
  SecretRef-backed auth-profile credentials and provider-level custom provider
  configuration during summarization, and formats LCM tool timestamps in the local
  timezone instead of UTC.
